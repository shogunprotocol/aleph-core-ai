# Shōgun Core AI - Private Pool Financial Intelligence Engine

Shōgun Core AI is an institutional-grade financial intelligence engine designed for institutions, family offices, and high-volume participants using Lisk and Zama networks. The system combines real-time blockchain data with comprehensive market intelligence—including news sentiment, prediction markets, and social media analysis—to deliver private fund movement capabilities through encrypted transactions.

Unlike traditional systems, Shōgun operates as a complete private financial analyst, processing thousands of data streams from news feeds, prediction markets, and social sentiment alongside encrypted on-chain data to optimize private yield generation and capital deployment through Lisk DEXes and Zama FHE pools.

## Core Technology

### Intelligent Opportunity Detection
The engine combines blockchain data with market intelligence for superior decision-making:

**Traditional Arbitrage Enhanced by Intelligence**
- **Triangular Arbitrage**: WLSK/ZAMA→ICE→SLSK/ZAMA→WLSK/ZAMA cycles with 0.45% profit margins, executed when news sentiment confirms market stability
- **Cross-DEX Arbitrage**: Price differential exploitation between IceCreamSwap and ArcherSwap (0.73% spread), timed using Polymarket confidence levels
- **IWBTC Premium Arbitrage**: Intelligent exploitation of IWBTC premium over wBTC (1.2% spread detected), enhanced by regulatory sentiment analysis

**Intelligence-Driven Execution Examples**
```python
# Scenario: Profitable arbitrage opportunity detected + bullish news sentiment
Opportunity: WLSK/ZAMA→ICE→SLSK/ZAMA→WLSK/ZAMA (0.51% profit)
News Sentiment: +0.67 (bullish regulatory news)
Prediction Market: 73% confidence in positive Bitcoin outcome
Decision: EXECUTE with increased position size

# Scenario: Profitable opportunity + negative regulatory news
Opportunity: Cross-DEX spread 0.83% profit potential  
News Analysis: "SEC investigation" mentioned in 3 recent articles
Risk Score: HIGH regulatory risk
Decision: REDUCE position size by 60% despite profitability
```

This intelligence layer transforms reactive arbitrage into predictive trading, enabling the system to anticipate market movements and optimize timing for maximum risk-adjusted returns.
